# City of Helsinki Design System

> A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. - [Design Systems Handbook](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook)

Helsinki Design System is an open-souce design system built by the City of Helsinki. It consists of tools for development and design as well as resources and guidelines for creating user-friendly, accessible solutions for the city.

## Getting started

**Are you a developer? If yes, you'll probably want to first check out the components in [hds-react](packages/react) and [hds-core](packages/core).**

Helsinki Design System uses [**Lerna**](https://lerna.js.org/) for running scripts across the repo as well as versioning and creating releases of the packages. [**Yarn workspaces**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) is used to manage dependencies. This allows the separate packages to reference each other via symlinks during local development.

### Commands

| Command                            | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| yarn                               | Install dependencies and link local packages.              |
| yarn start:\<platform>             | Start dev env for platform.                                |
| yarn build:\<platform>             | Build packages for platform.                               |
| lerna run build --scope \<package> | Build only \<package>.                                     |
| lerna publish                      | Publish packages that have changed since the last release. |

To ensure code quality in the repo, every package will have their `pre-commit` and `pre-push` scripts run automatically before git commit and push (added with [**Husky**](https://github.com/typicode/husky)).

## Contributing

The initial version of the Helsinki Design System is under development. We will accept new features, feature requests and help with improving the documentation in the future.
